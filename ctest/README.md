# Linear regression in case of equally spaced `x`

This is simple implementation of the linear regression (only linear coefficient) in case of
independent variable (`x`) is equally spaced (example: measurement of data in exactly equal
        time delta).

Implemented in `octave`, `python`, and `C`.
